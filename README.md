# bob-plugin-deeplx
This is a DeepL plugin for Bob. Based on [OwO-Network/DeepLX](https://github.com/OwO-Network/DeepLX).

## Intro
The functionality of this plugin is the same as the old [clubxdev/bob-plugin-deeplx](https://github.com/clubxdev/bob-plugin-deeplx).
The original author has stopped maintaining it, but DeepL supports new languages, so I had to rewrite a plugin to support all languages. This plugin and [OwO-Network/DeepLX](https://github.com/OwO-Network/DeepLX) are now maintained by me.

**`Alternatives` has been supported since [v1.0.2](https://github.com/char8x/bob-plugin-deeplx#v102), but you must use DeepLX greater or equal to [v0.7.7](https://github.com/OwO-Network/DeepLX).**

## Update Log
### v1.0.5
- Fix some prompt errors.

### v1.0.4
- Plugin prompt to switch to Chinese.
- Change the plugin name to `DeepL X`.

### v1.0.3
- Support for enabling `Alternatives` or disabling.

### v1.0.2
- Support for display `Alternatives`.
